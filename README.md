# Benders Decomposition

Benders' decomposition is such a technique often used to solve large-scale optimization problems. Also, it is used to solve two-stage stochastic programming models given its structure.

In this repository, we present a case study on two-stage stochastic programming where Benders' decomposition is implemented.
